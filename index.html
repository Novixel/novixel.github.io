            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, World! That's how it started. I use Python for most things—it's quick and portable.
                If the need arises, I'll use whatever language best suits the environment.
                
                I specialize in building automation scripts, API wrappers, and trading bots for cryptocurrency exchanges.
                Currently, I'm working on web development and security projects, always looking for new challenges to take on.
                
                As a self-taught developer, I'm constantly learning and improving my skills.
                
                A relatively new endeavor I've been exploring is electrical engineering.
        
                I'm currently working on a project involving a Raspberry Pi and a few controllers to build a physical trading bot.
                I plan to start with a basic AI-powered robot car that I can build with my kids.    
            </p>

        <div id="Skills" class="tabcontent">
            <h2>My Skills</h2>
            <p>
                I have a unique set of skills that have helped me navigate life. Give me a problem, and I'll find a solution. 
                It might not always be the most elegant fix, but you can bet it'll work. 
                I have a knack for troubleshooting—whether it's weird automotive issues, power tools acting up, or debugging stubborn code. 
                I've found that asking the right questions and truly understanding the problem is the key to getting to the root cause of any issue.
                When it comes to coding, I'm solid. I specialize in Python but can work with C++, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when needed. 
                I've built a variety of small to medium-sized software applications and have experience across multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and several Linux distributions.
                On top of that, I'm great with people. 
                Customer relations is one of my strong suits—I know how to build meaningful connections and provide top-tier service. 
                Whether it's clients, customers, or collaborators, I make sure the experience is smooth and professional.
